  <h3>About this page</h3>

  <p>
    This page was built to highlight actresses and actors that support female directors. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The data on this page comes from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/"><img src="/blue_short-tmdb.svg" alt="TMDB Logo" style="width: 150px;"></a> <br/>Regular updates pull new data through the TMDB API. 
  </p>

  <p>To keep the movie counts realistic, certain credits are excluded:
    <ul>
      <li>Movies shorter than 40 minutes</li>
      <li>Documentaries</li>
      <li>Not released movies</li>
      <li>Movies with more than 3 directors</li>
      <li>Movies without a release-date</li>
      <li>Movies identified as adult content</li>
      <li>Movies without an imdb_id</li>
      <li>Voice acting</li>
    </ul>

  </p>


  <p>There could be errors in the data, either due to how movies are defined on TMDB, or due to faults in the code. </p>

  <p>For example: Currently some actors and actresses doing adult content show up on the lists, as their movies aren't correctly identified as such on TMBD. </p>
